# Aframe XR Cardboard Demo
This is an Aframe-based 6DoF VR application using mobile AR for world tracking functionality. It is a work in progress. Check out the demo on a mobile device using the instructions below. 

## iOS
1. Go to the App store and download [WebXR Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056) by Mozilla.
2. Open the following URL: https://ccs-1l-f19.github.io/aframe-xr-cardboard-demo/boundary/index.html
3. You should see a popup titled "Allow usage of Device Motion?" Make sure Device Motion is enabled and click Confirm.
4. Wait for the "AR Session Started" message to disappear. Swipe down from the top to show the URL bar and click on the icon with three vertical sliders. You should see some yellow points appearing in the camera view.
5. If you slowly move the camera side to side while pointing it at the floor, you should see more yellow points appear, and eventually, an orange grid should appear. If it doesn't appear, try pointing the camera at a different surface. 

# Android

I have not been able to find a working WebXR-based AR demo for Android. If you find one, please post an issue!
